# admindashboard

Admin dashboard assignment via odin project

used publicly available icons.

The company logo and all other graphics were designed & edited by me through various applications

pseudo styling was used for advanced graphics


potential enhancement:

more animations/transitions related to icons

create a window element to contain projects that can be scrolled with mouse. could be implemented with javascript to create a continuous stream of potential projects
